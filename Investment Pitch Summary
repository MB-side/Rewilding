## THE OPPORTUNITY

### The Problem
- **A Disconnect:** Everyday Australians and purpose-driven businesses want to invest in nature but lack a direct, transparent, and trusted pathway.
- **$85 billion:** The annual value of Australia's ecosystem services is at risk.
- **A New Obligation:** Companies face growing pressure from customers and regulators to demonstrate real, positive environmental action beyond simple carbon offsetting.

### Our Solution: A Marketplace for Tangible Environmental Impact

The Australian Nature Restoration Platform is a fintech marketplace that allows **individuals and businesses** to invest directly in high-impact nature restoration projects.

-   **For Individuals:** Buy fractional shares in a project you care about. Watch it grow and earn a return.
-   **For Businesses:** Invest in a verified local project. Receive a verifiable "Impact Certificate" to share with your customers, staff, and stakeholders—a tangible ESG solution.

## MARKET & TIMING

### Why Now? The Convergence of Profit and Purpose.

**1. Carbon Market Maturity:** Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) are a key compliance tool, with prices forecast to rise significantly.
**2. Biodiversity Becomes an Asset:** Australia's **Nature Repair Act** has created a legislative framework for a national biodiversity market, turning ecological outcomes into tradeable assets.
**3. The SMB ESG Imperative:** Small and medium businesses need an affordable, authentic way to demonstrate their environmental commitment.

## BUSINESS MODEL

### How We Generate Returns

We develop projects that create value from restoring nature, stacking multiple revenue streams:

1.  **Carbon Credits (55%):** Our foundational revenue from sequestering carbon as forests regrow.
2.  **Biodiversity & Eco-Payments (20%):** Revenue from the new Nature Repair Market and other results-based payments for verified ecological outcomes (e.g., improved water quality).
3.  **Land Value Appreciation (20%):** As degraded land is restored to a healthy ecosystem, its intrinsic and market value increases, realised at a potential 10-year exit.
4.  **Sustainable Products (5%):** Ancillary income from ethical harvests like native honey or botanicals.
